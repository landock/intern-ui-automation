== Overview
This documentation is generated using Asciidoctor. Asciidoctor is a Ruby clone of Asciidoc. Asciidoc syntax is a simple markup language that can be used to generate other document formats including HTML.

== Prerequisites/Dependencies
In order to generate HTML documnetation from an Asciidoc file, you will need to first ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine.

Once Ruby is installed, use the gem command to install the Asciidoctor Ruby gem (module): `gem install asciidoctor`

The documentation also makes use of the optional coderay gem for source code syntax highlighting. Install coderay using gem: `gem install coderay`

Once you have Ruby and the Asciidoctor and coderay gems installed, you're all set to generate the HTML documentation.

== Building The HTML Documentation
A bash script exists in the repository that builds all of the asciidoc files (`.asc`) in the `docs/src` directory of the repository. Simply navigate to `[repository path]/docs` in bash (or git bash on Windows) and run: `./doc_build.sh`. This will build/rebuild all of the `.asc` source files and place them in the `/docs/build` directory.

NOTE: The docs must be re-built after edits are made in the corresponding `.asc` file in order for the changes to take effect in the HTML files.

TIP: If you wish to build the `.asc` files separately or exercise more control over the build process by using various options, the `asciidoctor` command can be used directly. The basic syntax is: `asciidoctor -b html -D [target_dir] filename.asc` where `[target_dir]` is the directory where the resulting HTML file should be placed.
